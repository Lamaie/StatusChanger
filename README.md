# Discord Status Changer

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of changing the status message in the Discord app. The script uses the `pyautogui` library to simulate mouse and keyboard actions, and allows the user to type a new status message using a prompt.

To use this script, you must have the `pyautogui` library installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:
`pip install pyautogui`

The script is designed to work on Windows systems with a 1080p screen resolution. Otherwise, it proceeds with the main logic of the script, which involves checking if Discord is already running, opening Discord if necessary, and simulating mouse and keyboard actions to change the status message and save the new status.
